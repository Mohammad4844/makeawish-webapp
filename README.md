## Make-A-Wish (GA) Problem Statement
- Creating a real-time communication platform for families across Georgia
- Promoting to families not in the program so every eligible child can make a wish
- Connecting families to support resources in their area
- Current availability of volunteers isn't enough to address the full scope of the task, which is the 900 children in Georgia waiting for their wishes to be fulfilled

## Our Solution
### Chatbot
A chatbot backed by OpenAI's GPT model, that solves communication issues between Make-A-Wish and families by:
  - Making communication instant rather than having to wait for a response
  - Volunteers' responsibilites become streamlined, and their conributions can now be focused on more targeted and impactful ways
### Web App
Web solutions to specific challenges faced by Make-A-Wish:
  - A document portal allowing families to upoad documents safely and at their own convenience
  - A dicussion board for alumni families to connect with each other
  
## How it Works
